# RHS M1A2 Sensor Enhancement Package v3

This small mod adds several minor improvements to the RHS M1A2, simulating features found in the recent SEP v3 upgrades.

The changes so far:

- Gunner and Commander optics have more information and better optics
- Main gun has full FCS capabilities

This is simply a config patch. It requires RHS USF to function.
